# StreakyCobra on Feb 10, 2016 | on: Ask HN: What do you use to manage dotfiles?
#
# I use:
#
#     git init --bare $HOME/.myconf
#     alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.myconf/ --work-tree=$HOME'
#     config config status.showUntrackedFiles no
#
# where my ~/.myconf directory is a git bare repository. Then any file within
# the home folder can be versioned with normal commands like:
#
#     config status
#     config add .vimrc
#     config commit -m "Add vimrc"
#     config add .config/redshift.conf
#     config commit -m "Add redshift config"
#     config push
#
# And so oneâ€¦
#
# No extra tooling, no symlinks, files are tracked on a version control system,
# you can use different branches for different computers, you can replicate you
# configuration easily on new installation.

# To complete the description of the workflow (for others), you can replicate
# your home directory on a new machine using the following command:
# 
#    git clone --separate-git-dir=~/.myconf /path/to/repo ~
# 
# This is the best solution I've seen so far, and I may adopt it next time I get
# the itch to reconfigure my environment.

# For posterity, note that this will fail if your home directory isn't empty. To
# get around that, clone the repo's working directory into a temporary directory
# first and then delete that directory,
# 
#     git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.myconf /path/to/repo $HOME/myconf-tmp
#     cp ~/myconf-tmp/.gitmodules ~  # If you use Git submodules
#     rm -r ~/myconf-tmp/
#     alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.myconf/ --work-tree=$HOME'
# 
# and then proceed as before.
